Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! - Richard P. Feynman (biography) (science) (good normal read)

books yet to find that I want to read this summer:
 - an older more acedemic book maybe philisophical or classical (something hard to read/understand to better my reading skills)
 - a 'light' programming book that is not a textbook, and more of a book about programming
    could be something like a biography, story, etc concerning programming i.e. how programming came to be and its history
